uranium-image-cleanup
--------

This is probably not neccessary since we are running this like an .exe

To use , simply do::

    >>> import uranium-image-cleanup 
    >>> import opencv as cv2
    
    >>> image uranium_nucleus_10593520
    >>> uranium-image-cleanup.removeLabel(uranium_nucleus_10593520)

    (maybe shivani can figure out some use here?)

    Think about how this could help other programmers, maybe one of ashtons pattern detections is that?
    Rather than this be something we just have our user run. 
    
    I think this will make our program look incredibly professional
